			<strong>Answers to the questions asked</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>What are sprites and why would use them?</strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Answer:</strong> The sprites are collection of logically separate images into a single big image (mostly vertical). <br>
			The advantages are <br>
				1) Reduced HTTP requests <br>
				2) You can compress the single image and hence total downloaded bytes would be reduced compared to multiple images <br>
				3) Overall it improves page load time <br>
				4) Easy maintenance, you don't need to maintain individual images.	<br>			
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>How do you go about creating them?</strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Answer:</strong> There are tools available to do that <br>
			
			1) Professional graphic designers can create it using Photoshop <br>
			2) If we already have HTML page with #No of background images, there are tools like <a href="http://spriteme.org" target="_blank"> SpriteMe </a>which can create sprite image for you. It can also create necessary CSS with classes which describes background positions for individual images <br>
			3) We can use CSS frameworks like <a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank"> Compass </a> which has inbuilt features of Spriting. They have commands by which we can generate sprint images, sprite image based classes and inject in CSS <br>

		<p>
			<strong>What are possible alternatives to sprites?</strong>
			<br>
			<strong>Answer:</strong> I know only one alternative for now, which is using data URIs in CSS.
